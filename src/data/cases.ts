Being an eventsource project Bamboo needed to overcome hydration limitations. Because of the always-increasing number of events, the app deployment process became challenging. During deployment all events should be processed, and the more events were created - the harder and longer deployments were. And with time the extensive amount of events make it almost impossible to release new features due to the hydration time limit.  So, the challenge for the TechMagic team was to find a solution for faster deployment without sacrificing app functionality and future growth.
