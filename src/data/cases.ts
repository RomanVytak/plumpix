      <h3>1. Discovery</h3>
      <p>We conducted a user needs analysis and market research, compiled a functional and technical requirements list, developed an implementation plan and budget, and created interface prototypes.</p>

      <h3>2. Design concept</h3>
      <p>Since most of the platform's users are children, we focused a great deal of attention on a creative, playful, non-intrusive, and enjoyable design.
      <br>
      The design concept for the LMS platform emphasizes a user-centric interface with intuitive navigation, modern aesthetics, interactive learning features, comprehensive course management tools, robust assessment options, performance analytics, integrated communication tools, seamless third-party integrations, and strong security measures to enhance the overall learning experience.</p>

      <h3>3. Development</h3>
      <p>Three developers worked on the LMS platform, emphasizing user feedback significantly. They focused on intuitive interface design, robust security measures, and thorough testing while ensuring comprehensive documentation and training for users and administrators.</p>

      <h3>4. Release</h3>
      <p>The fully operational platform was launched in just 6 months, and we are continually enhancing the LMS by adding new features as the product evolves.</p>

All the development decisions and challenges were based on that mission.  Being an eventsource project Bamboo needed to overcome hydration limitations. Because of the always-increasing number of events, the app deployment process became challenging. During deployment all events should be processed, and the more events were created - the harder and longer deployments were. And with time the extensive amount of events make it almost impossible to release new features due to the hydration time limit.  So, the challenge for the TechMagic team was to find a solution for faster deployment without sacrificing app functionality and future growth. At the same time we needed to implement a Bam Reward system and Bam token.',
